        <p class="objective_body">
            Short answer: we specialized in professional dog grooming, including cats and small animals, in the most relaxed environment. 
            We're cage-less. Really!
            <br><br>
            Not only do we bathe away dirt, debris and odours from the dog's coat, but we trim, thin, brush and fluff it as well. 
            We will diligently inspect your dog from the tip of its nose to the end of its wagging tail. 
            Even though we are not vets, but we can sometimes help to point out things which require a vet's attention that a busy pet owner may sometimes overlook. 
            We use only quality products that will leave your pet’s coat sparkling shiny, fresh and clean. 
            If you prefer to bring along your own special products, we are happy to use them. 
            Don’t forget, we groom cats and small animals as well!
