    <h3 class="intro_body1">Cage-less salon!</h3>
    <p class="intro_body2">Not only do we bathe away dirt, debris and odours from the dog's coat, but we trim, thin, brush and fluff it as well. We will diligently inspect your dog from the tip of its nose to the end of its wagging tail. Even though we are not vets, but we can sometimes help to point out things which require a vet's attention that a busy pet owner may sometimes overlook. We use only quality products that will leave your pet’s coat sparkling shiny, fresh and clean. If you prefer to bring along your own special products, we are happy to use them. Don’t forget, we groom cats and small animals as well!</p>

        <br><br>
        From the first time you book an appointment via phone, we'd like to know a little more about your furkid and yourself. Come experience our open-concept grooming salon on your schedule. Then let our prefoessional pet stylists do the bath, brush, trim while you may take a 1-2 minutes walk to Thomas Plaza to shop or enjoy a Starbucks brew.
        <br><br>
        If you have a specific time you need your dog to be picked up, please notify us at the time of drop-off. There is no additional fee to hold your dog for you until you are able to pick up.
